# Finalflash

**Finalflash** is a tool for correcting radio interferometric images using the uGMRT primary beam model. Inspired by Vegeta’s ultimate attack in Dragon Ball Z, this tool provides accurate corrections for uGMRT FITS images.

## Citation

If **Finalflash** saves your analysis from the chaos of uncorrected primary beams and handling CASA tasks, give it a little love in your acknowledgements! Add this line in the acknowledgement section:

*"Primary beam corrections were performed using Finalflash, hosted at [https://github.com/arpan-52/Finalflash](https://github.com/arpan-52/Finalflash)."*  

Until it makes its debut on ASCL or I finally write my holography paper, your acknowledgement would be *super* appreciated. As some random user in the internet mentioned:
"Science without ethics is like a spaceship without fuel—sure, it looks good, but it’s going nowhere."
